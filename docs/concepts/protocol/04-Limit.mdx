Limit Pools

Limit Positions function as a limit order consolidated to an invariant curve. Limit Positions utilize this process to collect the liquidity on a specified pair. 

The critical difference is that the buy and sell sides are split. The best-priced liquidity is aggregated for each respective trading direction to be accessed first.
This enables Limit Pools to enforce price priority.

Limit Pools allow users to undercut current market prices and receive prioritized execution, for example, offloading a large position before a significant market move. Users can operate Limit Pools by effectively undercutting the market price and filling the order.
