## Protocol, Interface, Labs

To start, it would be helpful to clarify the components of "Poolshark", some of which may
confuse new users.

- **The Poolshark Protocol**: A collection of persistent, non-upgradeable smart contracts that together create a protocol
  which facilitates trading of ERC-20 assets on Ethereum and other blockchains. 
- **The Poolshark Interface**: A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the Poolshark Protocol. The interface
  is only one of many ways to interact with the Poolshark Protocol.
- **Poolshark Labs**: the company that developed the Poolshark Protocol, the user interfaces associated with it, and the
  documentation website you are reading now.
- **Poolshark Limit V1**: the first version of **Limit Pools**, originally released in December 2023.
- **Poolshark Cover V1**: the first version of **Cover Pools**, publicly available but not yet released.
