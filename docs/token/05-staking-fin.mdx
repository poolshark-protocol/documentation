sFIN is the receipt token Users are granted once they stake their FIN token in the protocol. This token will represent their share of the total amount of FIN pooled in the staking pool within the protocol. This system will provide benefits and rewards to long term users of the protocol. 

When you stake FIN you get three rewards:

- Escrowed FIN (rFIN)
- Trading Fees
- Multiplier Points

## rFIN

Escrowed FIN (rFIN) can be used in two ways:

- Staked for further rewards for more FIN tokens
- Vest the rFIN tokens over 12 months and receive the FIN tokens in return

Each rFIN will earn the same amount of rewards as the FIN token. 

## Multiplier Points

When you stake FIN, users get multiplier points at a fixed rate of 100% APR, and rewards max out after 1 year of staking. For example, if you were to stake 100 FIN tokens you would earn 100 multiplier points. 

These multiplier points can be staked for fee rewards at the same rate, but at an increased rate of receiving rFIN. 

When FIN or rFIN tokens are unstaked, an exact proportion of multiplier points are burnt. For example, if you have 100 FIN staked and 50 multiplier points earned. Then, you decided to unstake 50 FIN this would burn 25 multiplier points ( (50/100) * 50). 

The “Boost Percentage” is calculated based on the ratio of Multiplier Points to your total amount of staked FIN:

Boost Percentage = 100 * (Staked Multiplier Points) / (Staked FIN + Staked rFIN).

## Vesting

rFIN tokens can be converted to FIN tokens through vesting.
