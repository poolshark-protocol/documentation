The Poolshark DAO is the entity that governs the protocol controlled by the sFIN holders. 

Voting power is derived from staking FIN tokens for sFIN, which is a 1:1 ratio of governance rights, meaning 1 FIN token will get you 1 sFIN of governance power. 

### Proposals

The DAO is able to initiate structured changes to the protocol via DAO proposals. Any member of the DAO is able to provide a proposal to improve the dApp. 

Here are some examples of topics related to potential governance proposals: 

- **Amount of Emissions on Liquidity Pool Pairs**
- ****************************Ecosystem Fund****************************
- **Fees on Liquidity Pools Pairs**
- **Treasury**
- **Which Protocols can have a Whitelisted Liquidity Pool Pairs**
