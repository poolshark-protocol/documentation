Poolshark's revenue comes from users exercising call options and redeeming FIN tokens at a discounted rate.

Poolshark discounts oFIN by 5-10% compared to the market Price of FIN. Which is based on demand and redeem percentage

Suppose Alice owns 1 oFIN token and intends to redeem it for 1 FIN token. The ongoing market price of the FIN token is $10, and the discount is 10% for redemption. However, Alice can use the oFIN token's call option to purchase that FIN token at $9 instead of $10. The difference amount is then directed towards the protocol treasury.

## Where does the Protocol Revenue go?

The protocol treasury receives all the protocol revenue. The DAO will create and vote on proposals to dictate how the income is distributed. There are multiple avenues to which the protocol will be streamed, which overall will make Poolshark a better product.

Here are some examples:

**Grants for External Developers**: Offering grants to external developers to build on top of the protocol can encourage innovation and diversification of services offered within the ecosystem.

**Liquidity Provision:** The DAO can increase the rewards for providing liquidity to selected pools within the protocol. Which will help in reducing slippage, improving trade efficiency, and attracting more users.

**Marketing**: Investing in marketing initiatives to increase the protocolâ€™s visibility and user base.

**Partnerships**: if Poolshark were to partner with a protocol, the DAO can dictate whether that pair will receive additional rewards to incentivize that pair to have higher liquidity.

**Referral Programs**: Implementing user reward programs or referral incentives to encourage more users to join and use the DApp.

**Trading Incentivization**: a determined amount of fees from the protocol treasury can be directed toward users who are swapping. This would incentivize users to utilize the dApp beyond just providing liquidity and staking FIN.
