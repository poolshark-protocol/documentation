**Community - 62% [12,400,000]**

We have carefully assigned tokens to different liquidity incentive programs, with a focus on ensuring long-term sustainability. The rates shown in this section will vary as the governance can change token distribution and the value of the token changes.

- **45.88%** [9,175,000] **Options Liquidity Mining Emissions -** *Released continuously over ??? years with distributions (governance)?*

Poolshark will emit FIN call options instead of standard FIN tokens.

These emissions will be significantly expanded to bootstrap protocol adoption, and the revenue generated will help increase the capacity of operations; learn more [here (Protocol Revenue)]. More details on how CVE call options work and why we chose this ***[[oFIN]](notion://www.notion.so/cve/cve-token/acquiring-cve-through-call-options)***.

*Biweekly Poolshark governance participants decide on emissions policy. The emission rate of >15 years was chosen to balance the need for incentivized rewards to early adopters while not distributing all CVE too early, which is required for long-term sustainability.*

- **22.94%** [4,587,500] ************Whitelisted Liquidity Pools Pairs -************ These are the direct partners that the DAO has agreed upon with the Poolshark Protocol.

The following partners have successfully passed the DAO governance and will receive additional FIN token emissions as an incentive to maintain liquidity on their pair within the protocol. Furthermore, that the rates at which these tokens are emitted to certain liquidity pool pairs are subject to change based on the DAO's decision.

- **10.32%** [2,064,375] **************************************************************************Non-Whitelisted Liquidity Pool Pairs************************************************************************** - These will be permissionless liquidity pools deployed onto Poolshark.

Due to the permissionless nature of Poolshark, any team or protocol can deploy on Poolshark without the need for whitelisting. The DAO can vote on whether they want to increase emissions towards non-whitelisted pairs as well. 

- **10% [2,000,000] Ecosystem Fund -** The allotted amount of tokens given to the DAO for ecosystem growth.

The fund will be managed by the DAO and used for ecosystem initiatives. Some examples are marketing, referral programs, partnerships, and more use cases. 

- **6.88%** [1,376,250] **************Traders************** - This program incentivizes traders to utilize the full capabilities of the Poolshark protocol.

This program is designed to incentivize users to make use of all the available features in Poolshark. This includes basic token swapping, as well as effective use of the "Limit Swap Order" to set price targets that can be fulfilled. This program will educate users about the full potential of the protocol and reward them for active participation. 

- **4.59%** [917,500] **************Stakers************** - Users who stake FIN.

Users who stake their FIN into the protocol will be rewarded with both trading fees and FIN tokens to reward their participation and alignment within the ecosystem. 

- **5%** [620,000] **Participants in the (omit first?) first public sale -** Claimable as a bonded token (go into more depth here).

Early adopters of the protocol were able to participate in a public raise where Poolshark worked with Bond Protocol to distribute bonds of the FIN token with a 2 month cliff. These expire on ____, and this sale was hosted at an FDV of 40,000,000. (add more here?) 

- 0.6975**%** [139,500] Testnet **Airdrop -** **Rewarded based on a point system via protocol usage and referrals.**
    
    To show appreciation for our early adopters who tested and experimented with the protocol.

The seed raised was allocated to strategic partners who could add more than just capital to the project. The allocation for each investor was between $10,000 and $500,000. These ticket sizes ensured no individual group or angel had an undue advantage regarding DAO governance. Since the beginning of our project, we listened to our community about raising capital; Every investor we chose reflects that. (go through alphakey and write this out)
