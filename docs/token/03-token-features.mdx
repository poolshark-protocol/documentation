## FIN Token

The governance token of Poolshark is FIN. Users can stake their tokens for a share of protocol revenue, FIN emissions, and governance over the platform. 

Users will need to stake the FIN token, and it will be returned to sFIN (there are no locking periods). 

Staking FIN token will provide three kinds of rewards:
 

- rFIN
- Multiplier Points
- Platform fees in (what token stables, eth?)
