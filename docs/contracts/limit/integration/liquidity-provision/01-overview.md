## Range vs. Limit

LimitPool contracts support both Range and Limit liquidity.

Range liquidity is a two-way liquidity position similar to those offered on Uniswap v3.

Limit liquidity is a one-way liquidity position only available on Poolshark.

Range benefits:
- bootstrap liquidity
- earn trading fees

Limit benefits:
- single-sided LPing
- one-way trading
- range buy or sell

NFTs are used to track fees for Range positions and claims for Limit positions.
